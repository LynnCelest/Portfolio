# Portfolio

Website to show case my profile. I plan to host it on Github websites.

My first stack was Nerds (Node, Express, React, databases with Sequelize). I learned this stack because sequelize is a ORM that nicely interacts with sql databases.

This project is built in the Mern (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack. This bypasses some sql set up and allows me to use Mongo's online database. I also implemented bootstrap and react-scripts which I'm using in this project without a team for the first time.

So far I have starting schemas for the database, express routers for api calls, and front end react router components (website pages) set up. Bootstrap is making the pages pretty. 'Npm run server' runs the server. 'Npm Start' runs the react app. 'Npm run start-dev runs both' I'm not sure if that's the most effecient way yet.

Stay Tuned for more!
