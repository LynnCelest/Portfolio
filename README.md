# Portfolio

Website to show case my profile. I plan to host it on Github websites.

My first stack was Nerds (Node, Express, React, databases with Sequelize). I learned this stack because sequelize is a ORM that nicely interacts with sql databases.

This project is built in the Mern (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack. This bypasses some sql set up and allows me to use Mongo's online database. I also implemented bootstrap and react-scripts which I'm using in this project for the first time.

So far I have starting schemas for the database, express routers for api calls, and front end react router components (website pages) set up. Bootstrap is making the pages pretty. 'Npm run server' runs the server. 'Npm Start' runs the react app.

Still need to learn more about react scripts and consider how I'll make my server run separately. My old projects were able to run react with webpack at the same time as the server or separately by just excluding webpack. I'm not sure if react scripts is different.

Stay Tuned for more!
